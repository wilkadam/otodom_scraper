<h3>Simple otodom.pl Scraper</h3>

It uses b4s and requests to scrape data from website and saves it to the sqlite Database.
If you run the script for the first time you need to add <i>create</i>, for example:

<b>python otodom.py create</b>

which will create appropriate database and tables. Then you can run it without the keyword <i>create</i>.
